Benchmarking breadth and length-bias detection with TUSCO-tissue. Relative to the universal set (|U| = 30 genes), the kidney-specific TUSCO set expands evaluable loci to 18 genes (+-12, +-40%), enabling tighter precision of sensitivity and FDR estimates at comparable read budgets. Using PacBio data, detection probability increased with transcript length (logistic OR per 1 kb = 2.845, 95% CI 1.319–6.137, p 0.00766) and the effect was stronger when assessed with the tissue set (AUC_universal = 0.707, AUC_tissue = 0.777; ΔAUC = 0.07). FN rates decreased from 100% in the shortest decile to 55.6% in the longest, consistent with a length-dependent detection pattern in kidney. These results show that TUSCO-tissue not only increases coverage but also improves power to diagnose platform- and tissue-specific biases, complementing replication (Fig. 5b) and captured in Fig. 5c and Fig. S3.
